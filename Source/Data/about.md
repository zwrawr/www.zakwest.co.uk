Hi, my name is Zak West and I'm a student at the University of York. 
I'm currently in my second year of a Electronics and Computing Engineering Masters. 
So far I'm really enjoying the course and doing pretty well (if I do say so myself).

I decided to create this website so that I can have a place to share the projects that I've been working on, and the ideas that have been on my mind. 
I'll be writing [blog posts][Blog_Link] about university assessments, open source projects I've contributing, As well as stuff like [Ludum Dare][LD_Link]. 
This site also serves as a place I can host [downloads][Files_Link] for these projects.
